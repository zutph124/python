#   In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input 
#   and then outputs that same input in lowercase. 
#   Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. 
#
#   Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, 
#   as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
#


text = input("Enter text: ")
print(text.lower())

# NEWER VERSION JAN 2023
text2 = input("Enter text2: ").lower()
print(text2)
