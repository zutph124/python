Recall that the re module comes with quite a few functions, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html, including search.
Recall that regular expressions support quite a few special characters, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax.
Because backslashes in regular expressions could be mistaken for escape sequences (like \n), best to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns, else pytest will warn with DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence. Just as format strings are prefixed with f, so are raw strings prefixed with r. For instance, instead of "harvard\.edu", use r"harvard\.edu".
Note that re.search, if passed a pattern with “capturing groups” (i.e., parentheses), returns a “match object,” per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects, wherein matches are 1-indexed, which you can access individually with group, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.group, or collectively with groups, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups.
