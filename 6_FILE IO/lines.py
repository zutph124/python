#
# In a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, 
# the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, 
# excluding comments and blank lines. 

# If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, 
# or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, 
# or if the specified file does not exist, 
# the program should instead exit via sys.exit.

# Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. 
# (A docstring should not be considered a comment.) 
# Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.
