'''
In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an 
arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value 
formatted to one decimal place. 
Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, 
with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer

For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. 
Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

!! THIS VERISON WILL ROUND AND DISPLAY FORMATED OUTPUT TO 2 DECIMAL POINT !!

'''

expression = input("Expression: ")
x, y, z = expression.split(" ")
#print(x, y, z) #debugger
x = float(x)
z = float(z)

if y == '+'   : print(f"{round(x + z,2):.2f}")    
elif y == '-' : print(f"{round(x - z,2):.2f}")
elif y == '*' : print(f"{round(x * z,2):.2f}")

elif y == '/' : print(x / z)
else : print("error")
