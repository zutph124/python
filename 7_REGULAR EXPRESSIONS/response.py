'''
In a file called response.py, using either validator-collection or validators from PyPI,
implement a program that prompts the user for an email address via input and then prints Valid or Invalid,
respectively, if the input is a syntatically valid email address.
You may not use re. And do not validate whether the email addressâ€™s domain name actually exists.

Note that you can install validator-collection with:
    pip install validator-collection
'''

from validator_collection import validators

def main():
    email = input("What's your email address? ")
    try:
        valid = validators.email(email)
        print("Valid")
    except:
        print("Invalid")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
